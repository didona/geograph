# 4-restarts scripts are a little counter-intuitive.  If *requiring a role* #
# implies this node *plays a role*, you can base restarts off of this.      #
# For example, if "pbsslave" is a required role, it implies this node is a  #
# PBS server and the pbsslave restart script could restart the PBS daemon   #
# since it's called after all the configuration is done (ipandhost scripts) #
